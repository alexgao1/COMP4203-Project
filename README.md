COMP 4203 - Winter 2020 Project

Cloned from https://gitlab.com/cjaikaeo/wsnsimpy/

Tested on **Windows 10**.
Requires **Python 3** or higher.

Setup:
1. Install required Python libraries:
   * SimPy
   * WsnSimPy
   * beautifultable
2. Acquire the contents of this repository locally.
3. Replace your system's `wsnsimpy` folder with our version of `wsnsimpy`. This can be done by copying it into either `%AppData%\Roaming\Python\Python<Version #>\site-packages` or `C:\Users\<Your User name>\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python<Version #>\Lib\site-packages` or wherever your `site-packages` folder is located. It may depend on how your Python version was installed. 
4. Run the Python scripts `3dma.py` or `onama_3dma.py` (found in [wsnsimpy\examples](wsnsimpy/examples)).
